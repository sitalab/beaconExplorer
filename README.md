BeaconExplorer
==============

The BeaconExplorer is a demo Google Glass app showing how to call the [SITA iBeacon Common Use Registry](https://www.developer.aero/BeaconRegistry).


What it does
============

The app is a simple use case showing how to use the two key APIs from the SITA iBeacon Common Use Registry. 

- Get list of beacons at an airport
- Get details about a beacon.

The first API is called on app startup. The second API is called when the user comes into proximity of a iBeacon, to get the meta-details for that iBeacon.
